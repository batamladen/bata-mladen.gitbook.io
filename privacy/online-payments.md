# Online Payments

In case of anonymous online payments, cryptocurrencys are a no-brainer option.

But not all cryptocurrencies are private. Bitcoin, for example is transparent, every transacion holds the sender and reciver information. Although it is decentralyzed it is not impossible to see who the sender is. Anyways better then paying via a bank account.

There are also currencies that are made for private and anonymous online payments. Use currencies like Monero, which hides the sender, receiver, and amount sent using three different privacy technologies.
