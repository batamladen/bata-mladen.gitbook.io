# The Onion Router

If Brave or DuckDuckGo are not enough safe for you, this is the final boss - tor.



The Onion Router or shortly TOR, is a privacy focused network that enables anonymous communication over the internet. It is widely used to protect user privacy, defend from monitoring and surveillance and for accessing restricted websites.

First, i will try to explain how it works and later on I will write what are the things that you can find on the hidden part of the internet and how not to f\*ck up your life.

## How does TOR work

Tor employs the "Onion Routing" technique by encrypting user data and passing it through several network relays. Consequently, a difficult-to-follow path and multi-layered encryption (think of layers like an onion) were made to protect the user's identity. Therefore, no one can associate your identity with a specific location.

Every time a new Tor relay hits, one encryption layer breaks, and the remaining data goes to any random relay until it gets to the intended server. The last exit relay or onion router node appears as the data's source to the destination server. As a result, it is difficult for any surveillance system serving as a middleman to identify the user or the server.\


The following picture will be used to visually explain how the tor works.

As you can see, Emilia's computer only knows the exit relay, and it puts it as the destination. the releys in between are randomly selected.\
The guard node receives the data, removes the outermost layer of encryption using Kn1 and sends the decrypted message to the relay node. The middle node removes the next layer using Kn2 and relays it to the exit node. Finally, the exit node decrypts the message with Kn3 and sends the original data to the web server (in this case peel-the-orange.com).

The layered encryption enables secrecy and limits knowledge about who is involved in the communication as only the nodes that know the keys can decrypt the messages.

Now that you know how things work around here, its time for your juicy reward...

I remember when I first started surfing the hidden part of the internet, dopamine levels were high as fu\*k. But I was always scared of this part of the internet, i heard a lot of stories, people looking at me through my camera the second i open tor, you are on FBI's blacklist the second you step on the darknet, people get killed for exploring this part of the internet etc...

Turns out, all was bullshit - mostly.

If you are concerned that people/governent are/is watching you throught the camera, plot twist: they are doing that even now - on the clearnet. Matter of fact, you are monitored, followed, recorded the second you turn on your laptop, pc or mobile phone. \
You are actually more safe on the darknet than on the clearnet, believe me.

## How to start on the Darknet

The first thing you want to do when surfing the darknet is going on the hidden wiki.\
The hidden wiki holds the links to all the websites that you may want to visit, that are 100% legit.

_"<mark style="color:yellow;">What do you mean legit?</mark>"_ you may ask.\
Well... Since on the tor network and on the darknet you are hard to be authenticated, witch the government does not like at all, the same government does the next thing. They wont chase you for surfing the darknet, but they will make a website.&#x20;

_"<mark style="color:yellow;">How can a website harm me?</mark>"_ You may ask.\
Well... If you are lets say, buying drugs from the darknet, the government knows that they cant do shit to you because you are pretty well hidden, they can shut down the website where drugs are sold, but tomorrow anotehr one will be created, so they make their own. They make their own claiming to sell drugs, and when you enter the addres where the drug is to be delivered (if you eneter your real addres you deserve to be put in jail for being dumb) the drugs wont arrive but the cops will.

Same goes if you for some reason want to order a hitman. If you do it from a non-reliable website (witch are like 98%) the person you send information about to the "hitman" wont be kill\*d, in fact it will be contacted to say if he knows someone who would want him dead. Your target will say a few names and those eople will be investigated.

And words of wiser than you: Don't do dumb shit like ordering a hitm0n, first of all it is a sin to take another persons life, and second it most likely wont work so don't even bother, find God instead.

## Hidden Wiki's

There are multipe hidden wiki's, but all do the same thing and acctualy they all hold the same links mostly.

Here is the list of the best wiki's:

* The Original Hidden Wiki
* Just Another Hidden Wiki
* OnionLinksV3
* Pug's Guide to Dark Web

## What can you do on the darknet

You can do all sorts of things on this part of the internet, from reading articles to buying illegal things.

I wont paste all the sites here, do your own research on the wiki's on your own responsibility, but I will tell you again, don't do nothing illegal. This part of the internet was mainly made for you to do the things you do on the daily basis but privately.

The best "illegal" thing you can do is find unpublished articles about corona virus, thruth about other 9political 11events :) \
Also there are a lot of websites that are not available on the clearnet because of the information you can find on them. For example, there is a website that tells you how to stay healthy, prevent cancer and other health problems.

If you want "illegal" things, find things like that. And I say "illegal" because it is mostly pirated articles and research papers. And if buying is not owning - piracy is not stealing. Fuck you Adobe.

## How to buy on the darknet

First is first, you want to stay anonymous and not expose your identity, IP etc... So here i will cover step by step how to stay under the radar and get the goods darknet has to offer (free books).



### Secure Distributor

Dont just type "pirated books" and go on the first link you see. Mostly you will find what you want on the hidden wiki. Go there first.



### Website Registration

Dont enter your real data when registering on the websites. You need to create a "sock puppet".\
Write this information for your sock puppet in your phone and use it for DW.

Name:\
Date of birth:\
Addres (ussualy a PO box):\
Email (create a new proton mail acc):\
Username:\


None of the above should be real. Use a online identity generator if you are not creative ([https://www.fakexy.com/fake-name-countries](https://www.fakexy.com/fake-name-countries))



### Payment

It goes without saying that you cant pay the regular bank or paypal way. You need to use cryptocurrency. Although crypto is more private it is not impossible to track who the buyer was, hence bitcoin blockchain is publicly available and payments can be tracked. And yes btc is mainly used for payments or monero.

No matter witch one it is you cant send "your" crypto. That is why you use a mixer. There are a lot of btc mixers on the hidden wiki, the most secure ones have a private wallet built in the mixer site. Do your research.

#### How the mixer works

You will send the wanted amount of crypto and the same amount will be sent back to you in about a day. Basically it is a pool of different peoples BTC and they are mixed all up and send to you, yours are sent to someone else's and they cant be tracked that way.

Darknet Rules:

1. NEVER USE THE DEEP WEB SOCK PUPPET FOR CLEARNET ORDERS, AND VICE VERSA.
2. NEVER USE AN ALREADY USED MAIL OR OTHER SERVICES ON THE DARKWEB. CREATE NEW FRESH ACCOUNT FOR EVERYTHING.
