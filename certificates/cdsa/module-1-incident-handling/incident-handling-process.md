# Incident Handling Process

Now that we are familiar with the cyber kill chain and its stages, we can better predict/anticipate the next steps in an attack and suggest appropriate countermeasures.

Just like the cyber kill chain, incident response follows a structured process. The **incident handling process** helps organizations **prepare, detect, and respond** to security events. However, its stages do not correspond directly to the cyber kill chain stages.

## **Stages of the Incident Handling Process**

According to **NIST**, the incident handling process consists of four distinct stages:

1. **Preparation**
   * Organizations establish security policies, train employees, and implement monitoring tools.
   * This is a continuous process to improve defenses and readiness.
2. **Detection & Analysis**
   * Security teams detect potential incidents using logs, alerts, and anomaly detection.
   * Proper analysis ensures accurate classification of incidents.
3. **Containment, Eradication & Recovery**
   * Contain the threat to prevent further damage.
   * Eradicate malware and compromised accounts.
   * Recover systems to resume normal operations.
4. **Post-Incident Activity**
   * Conduct lessons learned meetings.
   * Improve defenses based on findings.
   * Document the full incident report.

## **Key Points to Remember**

* Most time is spent in **Preparation** and **Detection & Analysis** stages.
* The process is **cyclic, not linear**, meaning new evidence can shift priorities.
* Skipping steps can lead to incomplete containment and tip off attackers.
* So, incident handling has two main activities, which are investigating and recovering.
* **Investigation** focuses on identifying patient zero, adversary tools, and compromised systems.
* **Recovery** ensures business continuity with a structured remediation plan.
* Final **reports** and **lessons learned** help prevent future incidents.

## **Quiz**

1.  What is the primary goal of the incident handling process?

    * a) To document all security incidents
    * b) To prepare, detect, and respond to malicious events
    * c) To track all network activity
    * d) To prevent hackers from scanning the network


2.  Which of the following is NOT a stage of the incident handling process?

    * a) Detection & Analysis
    * b) Preparation
    * c) Lateral Movement
    * d) Post-Incident Activity


3.  What is the main focus during the Preparation stage?

    * a) Blocking all external traffic
    * b) Training employees, setting policies, and implementing security tools
    * c) Investigating attack sources
    * d) Removing malware from infected machines


4.  Why is skipping steps in the incident handling process dangerous?

    * a) It saves time but reduces the efficiency of the recovery process
    * b) It can alert the attacker that they have been detected
    * c) It allows security teams to move faster
    * d) It helps contain the incident immediately


5. What is the purpose of post-incident activities?
   * a) To determine if an attack is still ongoing
   * b) To learn from the incident and improve security measures
   * c) To track attacker activity in real-time
   * d) To restore systems after an incident
