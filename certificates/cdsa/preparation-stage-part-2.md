# Preparation Stage (Part 2)

While protection isnâ€™t solely the responsibility of incident handlers, they must be aware of security measures to better analyze incidents and collect evidence.

## **Key Protective Measures**

### **DMARC (Email Security)**

* Prevents phishing by rejecting spoofed emails.
* Requires careful testing to avoid blocking legitimate emails.

### **Endpoint Hardening & EDR**

* Workstations are primary attack targets.
* Key protections:
  * Disable LLMNR/NetBIOS.
  * Implement LAPS & remove admin rights from users.
  * Configure PowerShell in **Constrained Language** mode.
  * Enable **Attack Surface Reduction (ASR)** rules in Microsoft Defender.
  * Implement whitelisting & block execution from user-writable folders.
  * Deploy **EDR** solutions that integrate with **AMSI**.

### **Network Protection**

* Use **network segmentation** to limit lateral movement.
* IDS/IPS systems work best with **SSL/TLS interception**.
* Use **802.1x** or **Conditional Access** to limit network access to approved devices.

### **Privilege Identity Management (PIM), MFA & Password Security**

* **Weak but complex** passwords are still easy to crack (e.g., "Password1!").
* Use **passphrases** instead (e.g., "i LIK3 my coffeE warm").
* Enforce **MFA** for all administrative access.

### **Vulnerability Scanning**

* Regularly scan and remediate **high** & **critical** vulnerabilities.
* If patches arenâ€™t possible, **segment** vulnerable systems.

### **User Awareness Training**

Training users to recognize suspicious behavior and report it when discovered is a big win for us. While it is unlikely to reach 100% success on this task, these trainings are known to significantly reduce the number of successful compromises. Periodic "surprise" testing should also be part of this training, including, for example, monthly phishing emails, dropped USB sticks in the office building, etc.

### **Active Directory Security Assessment**

* Identify misconfigurations & privilege escalation risks.
* Regularly review security settings & test for new vulnerabilities.

### **Purple Team Exercises**

* Red teams simulate attacks, blue teams defend and learn.
* Improves detection, logging, & incident response.

**Bottom Line:** Protection measures reduce risks but must be continuously tested and updated to stay ahead of threats. ðŸš€ðŸ”’
