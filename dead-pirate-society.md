# Dead Pirate Society

Applying for jobs and getting constantly f\*cked off in the last round interviews has got me startin' a blog sharing my day to day experiences :wilted\_rose:.

Jokes aside, didn't know where to fit this post so I decided starting a :sparkles:Blog:sparkles:.



### What is Dead Pirate Society?

Glad you aksed...

In my, not so long, journey of CTFs i have changed the same amount of teams as the amount of events i participated in. Every team i joined either died after 1 event or was barley active in ctfs but it was bangin' from pings in the "memes" channel.

The ones from the "upper" ladders had a qualification progress witch i had no interes in participating in (job applications are scary enough), and the only remaining option was to start my own team.



### Getting Crowded

The first step was to create a discord server and get arount 10 people so we can participate in our first ctf - witch was in 5 days.

My plan was to get in around 10 discord servers for the upcoming or past ctf events and search for channels market "team crafting" and copy paste an invite message in all of them.



### The Website

Me being me, i researched the top 30, 40 teams on ctf time and saw that most of them had websites where they post the team achivements and members. I did the same.

The website is pixelated theme because... why not? And had the team logo (witch is, you wont beleave it, also pixel art), and the website is a certified banger. \
If you don't think so... what tech stack is your  website? :bald:

When i made all that was left for the website is to update it regularly after each CTF with placements and writeups. The writeups are either from our team, or from other teams, we don't mind and don't care.



### Why DPS?

The original name was "Dead Bulgarian Society" since i could not find a living soul in Bulgaria that wanted to join me, but than ironically in the same day two Bulgarians reached out to me and i saw they both are actively participating in CTFs, and thought maybe its not that dead after all, and just decided to swap to "Dead Pirate Society", promoting and bringing back the dying piracy mindset that the modern world and companies are trying to cut off so hard. Fck you Adobe.

### Goal

Although i started this team alone, in just 5 days the team is already filled with 33 people which is more than enough to participate in ctf events even if ⅓ of the team is busy.

The goal is to learn while doing. \
The biggest focus in on reading and collecting solutions after the CTF ends and educate myself and the team in chall's that we could not find the solution for... all that while having a chill time knowing God damn good i'm not paying a dime in subscriptions...<br>

Love. \
