# Cybersecurity job landed!

After about 2 months of active search for a job in the cybersecurity field, we landed at KDN as a MDR Analyst. :detective:



I had a plan to apply to every job post i saw about SOC/Security/MDR analyst, go to all the interviews i get the opportunity for, and wait for the offers, if i get them, and see where would the best fit be for me.

I got ghosted :ghost: by about 50% of the companies that i applied to, and for the 50% that gave me a chance, i got to the last round interview at most of them tbh.

And the final decision was btw 2 companies from witch as mentioned above i choose KDN Bulgaria.

Currently waiting on update about the start date, will write more about the job itself in later blogs.



Brick by brick. :bricks:
