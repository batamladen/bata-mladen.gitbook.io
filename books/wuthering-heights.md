## Summary

**Wuthering Heights** by Emily Brontë is a gothic novel that explores themes of love, revenge, and the destructive effects of obsession. The story is set on the Yorkshire moors and revolves around two families: the Earnshaws of Wuthering Heights and the Lintons of Thrushcross Grange.

Mr. Earnshaw adopts a mysterious orphan, Heathcliff, who forms a deep and tumultuous bond with Earnshaw’s daughter, Catherine. Despite their mutual love, Catherine marries Edgar Linton, a wealthy neighbor, to improve her social status, devastating Heathcliff. Consumed by revenge, Heathcliff becomes ruthless, tormenting both families and manipulating their descendants in his quest for power and retribution.
