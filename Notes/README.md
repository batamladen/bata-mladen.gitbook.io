# Intro

## Notes

This space is created to be a second brain :brain: for the things I am learning, so I can come back here and remind myself about a certain topic if I need to.

The whole point of this notes is to keep things simple and understandable for me and hopefully for someone else as well.

Sharing the things I'm learning.

{% hint style="info" %}
I have taken this notes based on my own understandings and there might be something that I did not fully understand. Do not use the information here for any illegal activities, this is only for educational purpose.
