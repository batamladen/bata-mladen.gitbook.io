# Threat Hunting Glossary

A **glossary** is a list of terms with their definitions. Its like a mini dictionary for a specific feild.

* **Adversary**: An entity attempting unauthorized access to exploit an organization’s assets.
* **Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)**: A well-resourced, long-term cyber attack, often by nation-states.
* **Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)**: Patterns of behavior used by adversaries to conduct attacks.
  * **Tactics**: High-level goals of an attack.
  * **Techniques**: General methods used to achieve tactics.
  * **Procedures**: Specific step-by-step execution of techniques.
* **Indicator**: Data points used to detect potential malicious activity.

* **Threat**: A combination of intent, capability, and opportunity to cause harm.
* **Campaign**: A series of related cyber attacks sharing similar TTPs.
* **Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**: Digital evidence of a cyber attack (e.g., file hashes, IP addresses).
* **Pyramid of Pain**: A model showing the difficulty of detecting and countering adversary actions.

* **Hash Values**: Unique digital fingerprints of files used for identification.
* **IP Addresses**: Numerical labels identifying devices on a network, sometimes used in attacks.
* **Domain Names**: Website addresses that can be used for malicious purposes.
* **Network Artifacts**: Traces of attacker activity found in network logs and traffic.
* **Host Artifacts**: Evidence of attacker activity on individual systems (e.g., logs, registry changes).
* **Tools**: Software used by attackers, including malware and exploits.
* **TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures)**: The core methods used by attackers, hardest to change.
* **Diamond Model**: A framework linking adversary, capability, infrastructure, and victim in an attack.

#### **Answers**

1. **Adversary** – An entity attempting unauthorized access to exploit an organization’s assets.
2. **Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)** – A long-term, well-resourced cyber attack, often by nation-states.
3. **TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures)** – Patterns of behavior used by adversaries to conduct attacks.
4. **Tactics** – High-level attack goals; **Techniques** – General methods to achieve tactics; **Procedures** – Step-by-step execution of techniques.
5. **Indicator** – A data point used to detect potential malicious activity.
6. **Threat** – A combination of intent, capability, and opportunity to cause harm.
7. **Campaign** – A series of related cyber attacks sharing similar TTPs.
8. **Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)** – Digital evidence of cyber attacks, e.g., file hashes, IP addresses.
9. **Pyramid of Pain** – A model showing how difficult it is to detect and counter different adversary actions.
10. **Hash Value** – A unique digital fingerprint of a file used for identification.
11. **IP Addresses** – Identify devices on a network and can be used for malicious activities like DDoS attacks.
12. **Domain Names** – Website addresses that attackers can use for phishing, malware delivery, or command and control.
13. **Network Artifacts** – Traces of attacker activity in network logs and traffic analysis.
14. **Host Artifacts** – Evidence of attacker activity on individual systems, such as logs or registry changes.
15. **Tools** – Software used by attackers, including malware and exploits.
16. **TTPs** are the hardest to change because they define an attacker’s behavior and strategies, which require significant adaptation.
17. **Diamond Model** – A framework that links four elements in an attack: **adversary, capability, infrastructure, and victim**.
