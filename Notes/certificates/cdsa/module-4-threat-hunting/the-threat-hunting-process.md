# The Threat Hunting Process

## **The Threat Hunting Process**

Threat hunting is a proactive cybersecurity practice aimed at detecting and mitigating threats before they cause significant damage. Below is a detailed breakdown of the threat hunting process:

#### 1. Setting the Stage

The initial phase focuses on preparation and planning. It involves:

* Defining clear objectives based on threat intelligence and organizational priorities.
* Enabling comprehensive logging and ensuring security tools like SIEM, EDR, and IDS are properly configured.
* Keeping up to date with emerging threats and attacker tactics.

**Example:** The team reviews recent threat intelligence reports, identifies high-risk assets, and ensures logging mechanisms capture relevant data across servers, networks, and endpoints.

#### 2. Formulating Hypotheses

Threat hunters create educated assumptions about potential threats based on:

* Recent threat intelligence.
* Industry trends and security alerts.
* Professional intuition and past experience.

**Example:** A team hypothesizes that an attacker might exploit a known vulnerability in the web server to establish a command-and-control (C2) channel.

#### 3. Designing the Hunt

A structured approach is necessary to validate the hypothesis. This involves:

* Identifying the necessary data sources (e.g., log files, network traffic, endpoint telemetry).
* Selecting appropriate threat hunting methodologies.
* Defining search queries and analytical techniques.

**Example:** The team decides to analyze web server logs, monitor network traffic, and check endpoint telemetry for suspicious activities.

#### 4. Data Gathering and Examination

During this phase, the team collects and analyzes relevant data to validate or disprove their hypothesis.

* Log analysis, network traffic inspection, and endpoint forensics.
* Applying behavioral analysis and statistical methods.
* Utilizing threat intelligence feeds and open-source tools.

**Example:** The team detects unusual outbound traffic to a suspicious domain, indicating a possible C2 communication.

#### 5. Evaluating Findings and Testing Hypotheses

After analyzing the data, the team determines whether the hypothesis holds true and assesses the impact of the threat.

* Confirming or refuting the hypothesis.
* Identifying affected systems and evaluating potential damage.
* Documenting insights for further action.

**Example:** A series of failed login attempts from a known malicious IP confirms a brute-force attack attempt.

#### 6. Mitigating Threats

Once a threat is identified, remediation actions are taken:

* Isolating compromised systems.
* Removing malware and patching vulnerabilities.
* Updating security configurations and policies.

**Example:** If a system is communicating with a C2 server, it is isolated to prevent further damage, and forensic analysis is conducted.

#### 7. After the Hunt

Documentation and sharing of findings ensure continuous improvement.

* Updating threat intelligence platforms and detection rules.
* Refining incident response strategies.
* Enhancing security awareness through training and knowledge sharing.

**Example:** The team updates SIEM detection rules based on observed attack patterns and improves security playbooks.

#### 8. Continuous Learning and Enhancement

Threat hunting is an iterative process that evolves based on new threats and findings.

* Regularly refining hypotheses, techniques, and tools.
* Leveraging machine learning and automation for advanced threat detection.
* Participating in industry events and knowledge-sharing communities.

**Example:** The team integrates machine learning algorithms to detect anomalies and enhance their threat hunting capabilities.

## **The Threat Hunting Process VS Emotet**

To illustrate the threat hunting process, let's examine how it could be applied to hunting Emotet malware within an organization.

#### **Setting the Stage**

* Researching Emotetâ€™s tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).
* Identifying high-risk assets like email servers and privileged endpoints.
* Ensuring logs capture data on suspicious emails and file executions.

#### **Formulating Hypotheses**

* Hypothesis: "Emotet is using compromised email accounts to send phishing emails with malicious Word documents containing macros."

#### **Designing the Hunt**

* Analyzing email server logs for suspicious attachments.
* Examining network traffic for connections to known Emotet C2 servers.
* Checking endpoint logs for suspicious macro execution.

#### **Data Gathering and Examination**

* Inspecting email headers for phishing patterns.
* Analyzing network traffic captures for anomalous outbound connections.
* Using sandboxing tools to examine potentially malicious attachments.

#### **Evaluating Findings and Testing Hypotheses**

* Confirming phishing activity based on email patterns.
* Detecting C2 communications with known malicious IPs.
* Identifying compromised endpoints executing Emotet payloads.

#### **Mitigating Threats**

* Isolating affected systems.
* Removing malware and blocking malicious domains.
* Implementing email filtering and endpoint protection policies.

#### **After the Hunt**

* Updating detection rules for future Emotet campaigns.
* Sharing intelligence with industry groups.
* Enhancing security awareness training.

#### **Continuous Learning and Enhancement**

* Adapting hunting methodologies for evolving malware variants.
* Integrating automated detection techniques.
* Engaging in ongoing threat research and collaboration.

By following a structured threat hunting process, organizations can proactively detect and mitigate threats like Emotet before they cause widespread damage.
