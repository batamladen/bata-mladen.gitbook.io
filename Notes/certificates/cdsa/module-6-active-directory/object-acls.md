# Object ACLs

Each ACL has **Access Control Entries (ACEs)**â€”each one lists a **user or group** and their **permissions** (like read, write, or delete).

For example:

* Domain Admins can **change any userâ€™s password** by default.
* Specific rights (like resetting passwords or modifying groups) can be **delegated** to other users.

ACLs also support **auditing**, such as tracking who accessed or tried to access an object.

In big organizations, mistakes happen, like:

* Regular users getting too many rights
* Everyone being able to change everything
* LAPS (local admin passwords) being visible to all

Thatâ€™s why it's important to have **clear rules and processes** to manage access and remove rights when someone's role changes.

***

## Attack

To identify potential abusable ACLs, we will use [BloodHound](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound) to graph the relationships between the objects and [SharpHound](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/SharpHound) to scan the environment and pass `All` to the `-c` parameter (short version of `CollectionMethod`)

<mark style="color:yellow;">1.</mark>\
First we obviously need to use the scan command

The ZIP file generated by `SharpHound` can then be visualized in `BloodHound`. Instead of looking for every misconfigured ACL in the environment, we will focus on potential escalation paths that originate from the user Bob (our initial user, which we had already compromised and have complete control over). Therefore, the following image demonstrates the different access that Bob has to the environment:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/acl 2.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Bob has full rights over the user Anni and the computer Server01. Below is what Bob can do with each of these:

ðŸ”¹ **Case 1: Bob has full rights over user Anni**

* Bob can **change Anniâ€™s password** and **log in as her**. If Anni is a Domain Admin, Bob now has the same power.
* Bob can also **add a Service Principal Name (SPN)** to Anniâ€™s account and then use **Kerberoasting** to try to crack the password.

ðŸ”¹ **Case 2: Bob has full rights over Server01 (a computer object)**

* If **LAPS** is used, Bob can **view the local admin password** and log in as that account.
* Bob can also use **Resource-Based Kerberos Delegation (RBCD)** to impersonate any user when connecting to Server01.
* If Server01 is set for **Unconstrained Delegation**, and Bob controls it, he could **steal credentials** from Domain Controllers or other critical systems that connect to it â€” leading to **privilege escalation**.

We can also use [ADACLScanner](https://github.com/canix1/ADACLScanner) to create reports of `discretionary access control lists` (`DACLs`) and `system access control lists` (`SACLs`).

***

## Prevention

We can detect when AD objects are changed, but the logs donâ€™t always show **exactly what was changed**.

For example, if Bob adds an SPN to Anniâ€™s account (to later perform **Kerberoasting**), Windows will log **Event ID 4738**: _"A user account was changed."_

However, this event **wonâ€™t show** that an SPN was added â€” it just says the user was modified. So, while it's useful to know something changed, **it lacks detail** about **what** changed.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/acl 3.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

We can still spot suspicious actions by watching **who** made the change.

For example, if **only admins** have names like "adminXXXX", then any changes made by users **without** that naming pattern (like Bob) could be a red flag.

* If Bob resets someoneâ€™s password, Windows logs **Event ID 4724**.
* If Bob modifies a computer object (like Server01), **Event ID 4742** is logged.

These events donâ€™t show **exact details**, but they do show that **something was done** â€” and by **whom**. So, even if info is limited, they help detect misuse or abuse.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/acl 4.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

You can set up a **honeypot user** with **high permissions** and leak fake credentials (like in the description field). This could lure attackers to test the account.

Another method: create a **honeypot user** that **anyone can modify**. This account should look active but isnâ€™t supposed to be changed.

* If **Event ID 4738** appears for this user (showing a change), itâ€™s suspicious.
* When detected, **alert**, **disable** the user who made the change, and start a **forensic investigation**.

For example, if Bob changes Anniâ€™s account, this setup would catch it.
