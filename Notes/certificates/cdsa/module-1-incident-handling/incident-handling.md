# Incident Handling

## **Definition & Scope**

* **Incident Handling (IH):** A structured approach to managing and responding to security incidents in an organization.
* Organizations implement IH **in-house** or via **third-party providers**.
* **Event:** Any action occurring in a system or network (e.g., email sent, mouse click, firewall action).
* **Incident:** An event with a negative consequence (e.g., system crash, unauthorized access, data theft).
* **IT Security Incident:** An event with a clear intent to cause harm to a computer system (e.g., data theft, fund theft, malware installation).
* IH is **not limited** to intrusion incidents; it includes insider threats, availability issues, and intellectual property loss.
* IH aims to **identify, contain, eradicate, and recover** from incidents.
* Some suspicious events should be treated as incidents until proven otherwise.

## **Value of Incident Handling**

* IT security incidents **compromise personal & business data**, requiring **quick and effective** responses.
* Some incidents impact a few devices, while others affect large environments.
* **Incident Response Team (IRT):** Handles security incidents **systematically** to minimize theft and disruption.
* **Prioritization is crucial:** Incidents with greater severity require immediate action.
* **Incident Manager:** Leads the IRT (SOC manager, CISO, CIO, or trusted vendor) and ensures coordination and communication.
* **NIST’s Computer Security Incident Handling Guide** provides practical guidelines for responding to incidents.
