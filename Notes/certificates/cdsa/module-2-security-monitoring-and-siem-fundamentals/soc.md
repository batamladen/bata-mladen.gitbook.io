# SOC

## **What Is A SOC?**

* A **Security Operations Center (SOC)** is a centralized team of security experts responsible for **continuous monitoring, threat detection, and incident response**.
* The SOC team includes **security analysts, engineers, and managers** who work with incident response teams to address security threats.
* **Key technologies used by SOC teams:**
  * **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)**
  * **IDS/IPS (Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems)**
  * **EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response)**
* SOC teams follow structured **incident response processes**, including **triage, containment, elimination, and recovery**.
* The **goal of a SOC** is to **minimize security breaches and mitigate risks** to an organization.



***

## **How Does A SOC Work?**

* A SOC focuses on **operational security** rather than strategy, architecture, or policy development.
* **Key responsibilities of a SOC team:**
  * **Detecting, analyzing, responding to, and preventing** cybersecurity incidents.
  * Some SOCs include **forensic and malware analysis** for deeper investigations.
  * Works **closely with incident response teams** to maintain security posture.



***

## **Roles Within A SOC**

* **SOC Director**: Manages strategy, budgeting, and alignment with security objectives.
* **SOC Manager**: Oversees daily operations and coordinates incident response.
* **Tier 1 Analyst**: Monitors alerts, triages incidents, and escalates when necessary.
* **Tier 2 Analyst**: Investigates escalated threats, identifies trends, and develops mitigation plans.
* **Tier 3 Analyst**: Handles complex incidents, performs threat hunting, and enhances detection strategies.
* **Detection Engineer**: Creates and maintains detection rules for SIEM, IDS/IPS, and EDR.
* **Incident Responder**: Leads forensic investigations and remediation efforts.
* **Threat Intelligence Analyst**: Analyzes emerging threats to strengthen defenses.
* **Security Engineer**: Develops and maintains security tools and infrastructure.
* **Compliance & Governance Specialist**: Ensures adherence to regulations and standards.
* **Security Awareness Coordinator**: Educates employees on cybersecurity best practices.

### **SOC Tiered Structure**

* **Tier 1 (First Responders)**: Monitor, triage, and escalate incidents.
* **Tier 2 (Investigators)**: Perform deeper analysis and develop response strategies.
* **Tier 3 (Experts)**: Handle advanced threats, conduct research, and improve security defenses.

## **SOC Stages**

1. **SOC 1.0 (Legacy SOCs)**
   * Focused mainly on **network security**.
   * Lacked integration, leading to **uncoordinated alerts**.
   * Heavy reliance on **firewalls and antivirus**.
2. **SOC 2.0 (Modern SOCs)**
   * Integrates **threat intelligence, security telemetry, and anomaly detection**.
   * Uses **layer-7 analysis** to detect hidden threats.
   * Focuses on **situational awareness, vulnerability management, and incident response**.
3. **Cognitive SOC (Next-Gen SOCs)**
   * Incorporates **AI and machine learning** to enhance threat detection.
   * Bridges experience gaps with **automated learning systems**.
   * Improves collaboration between **security and business teams**.
   * Focuses on **standardized incident response and proactive defense**.

## **Conclusion**

* A **SOC is critical** to an organization's cybersecurity strategy, offering **continuous monitoring and rapid response** to threats.
* The **evolution from SOC 1.0 to Cognitive SOC** highlights the shift towards **AI-driven security and proactive threat hunting**.
* Effective SOC operations require **skilled personnel, strong technology, and well-defined processes**.
