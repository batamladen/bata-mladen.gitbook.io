# Browser

Knowing that Google is not the most private organization, neither is their browser, despite the good search results it gives, it saves a lot of information and has a lot of permission. \
So if you have a bit respect for your privacy just switch to **Brawe** or some other more private browser like DuckDuckGo etc...

## Brave

Brave is a privacy and ad-blocking focused browser, and like the majority of browsers it is built from Chromium. Brave also allows you to profit from blocking ads and earn crypto - you can turn this option off if you don't like it.

<mark style="color:blue;">**Tip:**</mark> Change configuration setting on Brave, hence it offers a lot of customization.
