# GUI

A Java GUI (Graphical User Interface) is a visual interface that allows users to interact with a Java program. It includes graphical components such as buttons, text fields, labels, and more, which users can interact with using a mouse, keyboard, or touch screen.

In Java, GUIs are typically created using the Swing or JavaFX libraries. These libraries provide classes and methods to create windows, dialogs, and various types of components, as well as manage events such as button clicks or mouse movements. GUI programming in Java involves creating these components, arranging them on a screen, and adding functionality to them using event handling.

The GUI is made in a separate class file in Java, but would be nice if it is in the same package at the class/es that you want to interact with.

Below is a explanation on using the set of Switch classes and components from the javax.switch package.
