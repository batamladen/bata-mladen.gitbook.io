# Network Security

Network security refers to the measures taken to protect the integrity and functionality of a network and its data. Every organization that deals with significant amounts of data implements various solutions to guard against cyber threats.

Network security involves any action aimed at safeguarding your network and data. This includes a wide range of software and hardware tools, as well as procedures, guidelines, and configurations for using and accessing the network, ensuring comprehensive threat protection.

A basic example of network security is password protection, where users create strong passwords to secure their accounts. Nowadays, network security is a key focus in cybersecurity, with many companies seeking individuals skilled in this area. Network security solutions help protect different vulnerabilities in computer systems, including:

* Users
* Locations
* Data
* Devices
* Applications

### Types of Network Security:

* [**Firewalls**:](firewalls.md) These act as a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks, such as the internet. They filter incoming and outgoing traffic based on predefined security rules.
* [**Intrusion Detection Systems**](intrusion-detection-systems-ids.md) [**(IDS)**](intrusion-detection-systems-ids.md) **and** [**Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)**](intrusion-prevention-systems-ips.md): IDS monitors network traffic for suspicious activity and alerts administrators. IPS goes a step further by automatically blocking or rejecting the suspicious traffic.
* **Antivirus and Antimalware Software**: These programs detect, prevent, and remove malicious software, such as viruses, worms, and ransomware, from computers and networks.
* [**Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)**](virtual-private-networks-vpns.md): VPNs create a secure, encrypted connection over a less secure network, typically the internet, allowing remote users to safely access the network as if they were directly connected.
* **Access Control**: This includes various methods to ensure that only authorized users can access network resources. Techniques include strong password policies, multi-factor authentication, and role-based access control.
* **Network Segmentation**: This involves dividing a network into smaller, isolated segments to reduce the risk of widespread breaches. Each segment can be secured separately, limiting the potential damage of a compromised section.
* **Email Security**: Tools and protocols designed to protect email accounts and communications from threats like phishing, spam, and unauthorized access.
* **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)**: SIEM systems collect and analyze data from various sources across the network to provide real-time analysis of security alerts generated by hardware and software.
* **Web Security**: Tools and measures to protect users from web-based threats. This includes web filtering, secure web gateways, and tools to prevent access to malicious websites.
