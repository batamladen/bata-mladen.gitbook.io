# RIP

## **What is RIP?**

**Routing Information Protocol** (RIP) is a dynamic routing protocol that uses hop count as a routing metric to find the best path between the source and the destination network. It is a distance-vector routing protocol that  works on the Network layer of the OSI model. \
RIP uses port number 520. \


### **Hop Count**&#x20;

Hop count is the number of routers occurring in between the source and destination network. The path with the lowest hop count is considered as the best route to reach a network and therefore placed in the routing table. RIP prevents routing loops by limiting the number of hops allowed in a path from source and destination. The maximum hop count allowed for RIP is 15 and a hop count of 16 is considered as network unreachable.&#x20;
