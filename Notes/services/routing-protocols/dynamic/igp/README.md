# IGP

**IGPs** are routing protocols that exchange routing information with other routers within a single autonomous system (AS). An AS is defined as one network or a collection of networks under the control of one enterprise.

All the IGP protocols can be classified into the following:

* [Distance Vector](distance-vector/)
* [Link-State](link-state/)
* [Hybrid](hybrid/)
