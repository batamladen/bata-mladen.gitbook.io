# Dynamic

Dynamic routing protocols, as their name suggests, are used to dynamically exchange routing information between routers. Their implementation allows network topologies to dynamically adjust to changing network conditions, and to ensure that efficient and redundant routing continues in spite of any changes.

{% hint style="success" %}
**Definition:**\
Dynamic routing is a mechanism through which routing information is exchanged between routers to determine the optimal path between network devices. A routing protocol is used to identify and announce network paths.

Compared to statically configuring routing in topology, the implementation of dynamic routing protocols vastly improves the scalability of networks.

The first dynamic routing protocol was the [Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP)](egp/)
