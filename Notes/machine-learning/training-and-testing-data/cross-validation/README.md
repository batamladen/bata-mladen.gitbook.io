# Cross Validation

## What is cross validation?

Cross-validation is a more robust method to evaluate the model's performance. It involves splitting the data into `k` subsets (folds) and performing the training and testing `k` times, each time using a different fold as the test set and the remaining folds as the training set. This provides multiple performance estimates, reducing the risk of overfitting.
