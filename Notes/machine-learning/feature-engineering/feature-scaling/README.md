# Feature Scaling

In Machine Learning we train our data to predict or classify things in such a manner that isnâ€™t hardcoded in the machine. So for the first, we have the Dataset or the input data to be pre-processed and manipulated for our desired outcomes. Any ML Model to be built follows the following procedure:

* Collect Data
* Perform Data Munging/Cleaning (Feature Scaling)
* Pre-Process Data
* Apply Visualizations

Scailing is required when we use any machine learning algorithm that requires gradient calculation

**Feature Scaling** is a method to standardize the features present in the data in a fixed range. It has to perform during the data pre-processing. It has two main ways:[ Standardization](standardization/) and [Normalization](normalization.md).
