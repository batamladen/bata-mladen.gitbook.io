## My experience with CDSA

I was aiming for my first job as a SOC Analyst and wanted to get to know my future job better, so i decided to take a blue team course.

I am the type of guy that wants to know all of the sources available for the certain thing, and pick the best one for me.

I researched all the available courses and all the things that one certificate should include.\
From the community recgogdization, quality of the amterial, hands on exercises, pricing etc...

And at the end of my research the finalist was clear - CDSA by HTB.
