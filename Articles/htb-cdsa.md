## CDSA

I was aiming for my first job as a SOC Analyst and wanted to get to know my future job better, so i decided to take a blue team course.

I researched all the available courses and all the things that one certificate should include.\
From the community recgogdization, quality of the amterial, hands on exercises, pricing etc...

And at the end of my research the finalist was clear - CDSA by HTB.
